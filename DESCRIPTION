Description:
    TepR (Transcription elongation profile in R) is a package for analyzing 
    data from nascent RNA sequencing data (TT-seq, mNET-seq, PRO-seq, etc.).
    The general principle relies on calculating the cumulative signal of nascent
    RNA sequencing over the gene body of any given gene or transcription unit.
    TePR can identify transcription attenuation sites by comparing profile to a
    null model which assumes uniform read density over the entirety of the
    transcriptional unit. It can also identify increased or diminished
    transcription attenuation by comparing two conditions. Besides rigorous
    statistical testing and high sensitivity, a major feature of TepR is its
    ability to provide the elongation pattern of each individual gene, including
    the position of the main attenuation point when such a phenomenon occurs.
    Using TepR, users can visualize and refine genome-wide aggregated analyses
    of elongation patterns to robustly identify effects specific to subsets of
    genes. These metrics are suitable for internal comparisons (between genes
    in each condition) and for studying elongation of the same gene in different
    conditions or comparing it to a perfect theoretical uniform elongation.
