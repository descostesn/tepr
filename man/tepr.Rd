\value{
A list of data.frame made of two elements. The first data.frame is the
result of the function 'meandifference': For each condition, it provides
the mean values for the "value" and "Fx" columns (e.g. mean_value_ctrl, 
mean_Fx_ctrl columns) as the differences between the Fx column and coordinate
ratios (e.g., diff_Fx_ctrl column). The second data.frame is the result of
the function 'universegroup': It contains columns concerning AUC, knee
position, attenuation information, and columns defining the universe and
groups (see details).
}
\description{
This function wraps the different steps of tepr to identify transcripts
with a significantly different nascent rna-seq signal.
}
\details{
The tepr function calls successively:
\itemize{
  \item averageandfilterexprs This function calculates the average expression levels for transcripts from alldf that was obtained with the 'preprocessing' function. It filters out transcripts based on the 'expthres' expression threshold. The function also renames the columns in the output data frame to include mean expression values. It returns a list containing the original alldf with the mean columns added and a character vector of transcripts that meet the filtering criteria.
  \item countna It takes the result of 'averageandfilterexprs' as input and counts the number of NA values for each transcript based on strand and condition. NA represent missing scores that were filtered out from the black list and mappability track. It returns a data frame where each row corresponds to a transcript, along with its associated gene, strand, and the count of NA values.
  \item genesECDF It takes the result of 'averageandfilterexprs' as input and a) filters the main expression table to retain only the expressed transcripts; b) Splits the data by each transcript; c) For each transcript, computes ECDF values for the score columns while respecting the strand orientation ("plus" or "minus"); d) Combines the ECDF results into a final data frame. It returns a list containing two elements: A data frame with ECDF results for each transcript (concatdf) and an integer indicating the number of rows in each transcript table.
  \item meandifference It takes the result of 'genesECDF' as input and calculates the mean values, mean Fx (ECDF) and ECDF differences (Fx) for expression data, across different experimental conditions. It returns a data frame that contains, for each condition: mean values for the "value" and "Fx" columns (e.g., \code{mean_value_ctrl}, \code{mean_Fx_ctrl}) and the differences between the \code{Fx} column and coordinate ratios (e.g., \code{diff_Fx_ctrl}).
  \item Splitting Split the results of 'meandifference' by transcripts and stores the list into bytranslistmean.
  \item allauc It uses the previously computed variable 'bytranslistmean' and it computes the Area Under Curve (AUC) and the differences of AUC between two conditions for a list of transcript data. It returns a data frame containing the AUC and dAUC results for each transcript, along with associated statistical information.
  \item kneeid It uses the previously computed variable 'bytranslistmean' and identifies the knee point (i.e., point of maximum change) and the maximum difference in the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) for each transcript, across different experimental conditions. It returns a data frame where each row corresponds to a transcript and contains the coordinates of the knee point and the maximum ECDF difference for each condition.
  \item attenuation It uses the results of the previous functions and it computes the attenuation values for each window of each transcript. It returns a data frame containing the computed attenuation values along with associated transcript information.
  \item universegroup Using the table produced by 'attenuation', it categorizes genes into a "Universe" and assigns them into groups such as "Attenuated" or "Outgroup" based on transcription data and thresholds. The universe is defined by thresholds for window size, missing data count, mean transcription levels, and p-values. Genes are further classified into groups based on conditions related to AUC and p-value thresholds. A transcript belongs to "Universe" if (window_size > windsizethres & Count_NA < countnathres & meanctrl > meanctrlthres & meanstress > meanstressthres & pvaltheory > pvaltheorythres). A transcript belongs to the groups: - \strong{Attenuated}: if Universe == TRUE & aucstress > aucstressthres & -log10(pvalks) > attenuatedpvalksthres. - \strong{Outgroup}: if Universe == TRUE & pvalks > outgrouppvalksthres & aucctrl > aucctrlthreshigher & aucctrl < aucctrlthreslower.
