\usage{
blacklisthighmap(maptrackpath, blacklistpath, exptabpath,
   nbcputrans, allwindowsbed, windsize, genomename, saveobjectpath = NA,
   tmpfold = file.path(getwd(), "tmptepr"), reload = FALSE, showtime = FALSE,
   showmemory = FALSE, chromtab = NA, forcechrom = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{maptrackpath}{Character string. Path to the mappability track file.}

\item{blacklistpath}{Character string. Path to the blacklist regions file.}

\item{exptabpath}{Path to the experiment table file containing a table with
columns named 'condition', 'replicate', 'strand', and 'path'.}

\item{nbcputrans}{Number of CPU cores to use for transcript-level operations.}

\item{allwindowsbed}{Data frame. BED-formatted data frame obtained with the
function 'makewindows'.}

\item{windsize}{An integer specifying the size of the genomic windows.}

\item{genomename}{Character string. A valid UCSC genome name. It is used to
retrieve chromosome metadata, such as names and lengths.}

\item{saveobjectpath}{Path to save intermediate R objects. Default is `NA`
and R objects are not saved.}

\item{tmpfold}{A character string specifying the temporary folder for saving
output files. The temporary files contain the scores for each bedgraph on
each chromosome. Default is \code{file.path(getwd(), "tmptepr")}.}

\item{reload}{Logical. If `TRUE`, reloads existing saved objects to avoid
recomputation. Default is `FALSE`. If the function failed during object
saving, make sure to delete the corresponding object.}

\item{showtime}{A logical value indicating whether to display processing
time.}

\item{showmemory}{A logical value indicating whether to display memory usage 
during processing.}

\item{chromtab}{A Seqinfo object retrieved with the rtracklayer method
SeqinfoForUCSCGenome. If NA, the method is called automatically. Default is
NA.}

\item{forcechrom}{Logical indicating if the presence of non-canonical
chromosomes in chromtab (if not NA) should trigger an error. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to display detailed
processing messages.}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value directly. It saves
intermediate results to `tmpfold`. These intermediates files are then
combined by the function 'createtablescores'.
}
\description{
This function processes genomic data to remove scores that fall within
blacklisted regions or have low mappability, and computes weighted means for
overlapping windows. The process ensures the integrity of genomic scores by
focusing on high mappability regions and excluding blacklisted intervals.
}
\details{
The `blacklisthighmap` function iterates through chromosomes, processes
genomic scores by removing those overlapping with blacklisted regions, and
ensures that scores within windows are computed using a weighted mean when
overlaps occur. The function uses parallel processing for efficiency and
supports saving (saveobjectpath) and reloading (reload) intermediate results
to optimize workflow.

The main steps include:
- Reading and processing bedGraph values.
- Removing scores overlapping with blacklisted or low mappability regions.
- Computing weighted means for overlapping scores in genomic windows.
- Saving the processed results to specified path (tmpfold).

If chromtab is left to NA, the chromosome information is automatically
retrieved from the UCSC server using `genomename`. Otherwise, the Seqinfo
object can be retrieved with:
     chromtab <- rtracklayer::SeqinfoForUCSCGenome(genomename)
