\title{Retrieve and Combine Annotation Information}
\usage{
retrieveanno(exptabpath, gencodepath, saveobjectpath = NA, showtime = FALSE,
verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{exptabpath}{Path to the experiment table file containing a table with
columns named 'condition', 'replicate', 'strand', and 'path'.}

\item{gencodepath}{Path to the GENCODE annotation file.}

\item{saveobjectpath}{Path to save intermediate R objects. Default is `NA`
and R objects are not saved.}

\item{showtime}{Logical. If `TRUE`, displays timing information. Default is
`FALSE`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE`, provides detailed messages during
execution. Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the combined annotation information for
 protein-coding and long non-coding RNA transcripts. If `saveobjectpath` is
 not `NA`, the object is also saved as an RDS file in the specified
 directory.
}
\description{
This function filters gencode annotations to retrieve "transcript". It then
distinguishes transcripts coming from protein coding genes (MANE_Select) and
those coming from long non-coding genes (lncRNA, Ensembl_canonical).
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Reads experimental data from the provided CSV file and validates it.
2. Reads genomic annotations from the gencode file and filters for
 transcripts.
3. Separately processes protein-coding and long non-coding RNA transcripts:
   - For protein-coding genes, selects the most representative (MANE_Select
 or Ensembl_canonical) transcripts.
   - For long non-coding RNAs, filters out transcripts with undesirable
 evidence levels.
4. Combines these annotations into a single data frame, labeling each
 transcript with its biotype.
5. Optionally saves the resulting data frame as an RDS file in the specified
 directory.
6. Optionally reports the total time taken for analysis.
