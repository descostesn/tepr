v1.1.2:
- Modifications and corrections to pass R CMD check.
- Creation of .returnexpcolnames in utils.R.
- Simplification of averageandfilterexprs and create subfunction .expressedtrans.
- In .computeecdf, under the comment "Shrink the results back to the transtable keeping ecdf columns", change code to remove the 'dot' usage which throws an error by R CMD check.
- In .computeecdf, also change the way column names are modified under the comment "Removing strand from column names" for the same reason.
- In .normalizeandsummarize, replace code for "Selecting coord and mean values" to remove the use of dot.
- Add a .github/workflows that test the package on windows, macos, and ubuntu
- Add a .Rbuildignore to exclude the .github folder and manual.pdf during package creation
- Correct bug about direction in loop if dfstrandlist of the function .expressedtrans in averageandfilterexprs.
- Folder inst/extdata reduced from 111 Mb to 504K
- Add error if no transcript is identified as expressed in averageandfilterexprs. This case prevents the rest of the  code to be executed.
- Add a README.md
- Change outfold = "." parameter to outfold = getwd() in plotauc, plotecdf, plothistoknee, plotmetagenes, and plotmulti to avoid potential errors with windows.
- Change tmpfold = "./tmp" to tmpfold = "tmp" in blacklisthighmap and preprocessing to avoid potential errors with windows.
- Change finaltabpath = "./" to finaltabpath = getwd() in createtablescores and preprocessing to avoid potential errors with windows.
- Change workingdir = "." to workingdir = getwd() in joinfiles.
- Rename the default 'tmp' folder by 'tmptepr' to avoid issues of pre-allocated space. Define the default path with file.path(getwd(), "tmptepr").
- In .mergefiles of createtablescores, add specific code when OS is windows. It uses a power-shell syntax and system2.
- add file encoding utf8 for windows check in createtablescores.

-- vignette
- With the reduced data of the package, the preprocesssing in the "quick start" section of the vignette now takes 38 seconds instead of 7 minutes.
- Use two different exptab in the package. One for preprocessing and one for the downstream analysis. The code of the quick start section is modified accordingly.
- The downstream part is now done on 6 transcripts instead of a 100. This aims at reducing the size of the package.
- Display the results of the quick start code
- Improve preprocessing description
- Reduce code in different sections since quickstart is now executed in background
- Add '?' before function names
- add figure of the global structure of the package
- remove explicit path to current directory and use getwd where appropriate
- remove outfold from plot functions in annex
- add optional line in quickstart to get chromtab
- remove preprocessing in bash section


v1.1.1:
- Optimize the vignette text with Gemini.
- Update output of the full tepr analysis in annex of the vignette.
- Add allauc and update doc of kneeallconds.
- Updated pictures in vignette.


v1.1.0:
- Create a showallcomp function to choose what to exclude in teprmulti dontcompare parameter.

v1.0.4:
- Remove dontcompare parameter from allauc and tepr.
