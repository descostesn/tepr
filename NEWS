- add file encoding utf8 for windows check in createtablescores.

-- vignette
- With the reduced data of the package, the preprocesssing in the "quick start" section of the vignette now takes 38 seconds instead of 7 minutes.
- Use two different exptab in the package. One for preprocessing and one for the downstream analysis. The code of the quick start section is modified accordingly.
- The downstream part is now done on 6 transcripts instead of a 100. This aims at reducing the size of the package.
- Display the results of the quick start code
- Improve preprocessing description
- Reduce code in different sections since quickstart is now executed in background
- Add '?' before function names
- add figure of the global structure of the package
- remove explicit path to current directory and use getwd where appropriate
- remove outfold from plot functions in annex
- add optional line in quickstart to get chromtab
- remove preprocessing in bash section
